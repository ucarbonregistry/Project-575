The objective of this project is to generate electricity using an environmentally clean and renewable 
source – solar energy. The project involves the planned installation of three photovoltaic (PV) 
power plants on the territory of an existing factory. The electrical energy produced by the solar 
power plants will be consumed for the factory's own needs. 
 
Implementation Timeline: 
2022: A 150 kW solar power plant was commissioned on the roofs of the canteen and fire 
station buildings. 
 
2023: A 180 kW solar power plant was installed and commissioned. 

The project implementation schedule is placed below:

Capacity /Location/ Supplier / Date of Commissioning 
__________
150 kW /FE LLC «Birinchi rezinotexnika zavodi» / «TOSHELECTROAPPARAT» LLC /31.05.2022 
__________
180 kW /FE LLC «Birinchi rezinotexnika zavodi» /«Max Expert» LLC /13.11.2023

The primary equipment of the PV plants includes photovoltaic modules, grid-tie inverters, and 
electricity metering devices. 
The baseline scenario prior to the project's implementation assumed that the power supply for the 
enterprise's administrative and amenity buildings was fully provided by purchasing electricity from 
the Angren City Electric Grid Enterprise, whose generation is based on fossil fuels. 
Feeding electricity into the grid is not planned. 
Electricity production using photovoltaic systems is an environmentally clean process, as it does not 
require the combustion of fossil fuels and is not accompanied by greenhouse gas emissions. Thus, 
the project contributes to climate change mitigation by displacing carbon-intensive generation in the 
regional energy system. 
The environmental effect of the project consists of the displacement of anthropogenic greenhouse 
gas emissions, estimated at approximately 206 tons of CO2-equivalent per year, by displacing  
368.66  MWh/year of grid electricity generated from fossil fuels.
